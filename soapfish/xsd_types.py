"""
Python class to map data types from XSD schema as accurately as possible.

We need to define custom data types because built-in Python types sometimes don't match definitions for XSD.

For example xsd.Date might contain a timezone reference but that is not allowed for datetime.date.

    Currently this class only supports dates representable by Python's datetime.date (with an optional time zone
