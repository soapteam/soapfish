Contributing
============

Contributions to the project can take many forms.

Document missing features
-------------------------

I won't even pretend to understand the XML/XSD semantics completely so there is a good chance I missed something.

You can help by submitting examples of XML (with the according schema) which soapfish currently can not handle. Ideally
you'd write a unit test which clearly demonstrates the failure.

Please try to minimize the sample as much as possible. We know this can be time-consuming but otherwise another
developer has to do it, taking away precious development time.

Implement missing features
--------------------------

Well, of course that's most helpful.

Some advice about the order in which new features should be implemented:

#. Ensure that you can express the XSD schema using the classes from ``soapfish.xsdspec``. This is the actual schema
   representation without any semantic sugar.
#. Build your schema in soapfish.xsd elements which is the high-level API. Try to build the object graph as you need.
#. Ensure that the assigned values in the object graph can be parsed and serialized to XML.
#. Implement XSD generation using your object graph.
#. Implement code-generation based on a pre-built XSD representing your use-case.
